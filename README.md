# How does the prime age of a NFL player change based on what position they play in football?
This research study aims to investigate the relationship between a player's prime age and the position they play in football. The prime age of an athlete is often regarded as the period when they exhibit optimal physical performance and skill proficiency. This study seeks to determine how the prime age varies across different positions, using machine learning techniques, specifically a linear regression model. The diverse physical demands and unique skill sets required by different positions contribute to varying ages where a football player peaks. For example kickers, punters, and quarterbacks are often protected from severe contact while linemen, tight ends, and running backs experience more intense physical confrontations. In this research we are regressing to one comprehensive performance metric across the different positions to assess at what age the average player at that position is expected to perform at their best. Other important variables that will be built into this model are playersâ€™ height, weight, and combine data. By analyzing historical data encompassing player positions and their corresponding prime ages, this research endeavors to unveil patterns and trends that can shed light on the influence of positional demands on an athlete's peak performance period. The outcomes of this study could have implications for player development, training strategies, and team composition, contributing to a deeper understanding of the nuanced relationship between player position and prime age. This will also provide a better understanding for general managers to alter their recruiting strategies and shape how players receive contracts in different positions based on expected future performance.
